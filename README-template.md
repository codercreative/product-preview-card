## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### Code issues and considerations along the way

- Considered using a helper class for margin-bottom to make the code DRY. However, with such a small project, I decided not to.

### Code snippets

Here are my favorite code samples for this project:

To get rid of the spaces around the wrapper, had to be reminded of:

```css
body {
  margin: 0;
}
```

To make the button as wide as the container, this code did the trick:

```css
.btn {
  width: 100%;
}
```

### CSS tips

REWRITE==

- Youtube episode about
  [rems (-> in relation to root/html) instead of ems for fontsizes, as ems cause compounding problems. Use ems for margin and padding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pautqDqa54I)
